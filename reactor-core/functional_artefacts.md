# Functional Artefacts

Functional reusable blocks are core and mostly a required artefact to use as soon as you get into Reactor. [1] So what’s cool about Functional Programming ? One of the core ideas is to start treating executable code as a data like another. [2] To some extent it is akin to the concept of Closures or Anonymous Functions, where business logic can be decided by the original caller. It also avoids loads of imperative IF/SWITCH blocks and makes a clear separation of concerns: each block achieves one purpose and doesn’t need to share anything.
