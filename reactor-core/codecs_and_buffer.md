# Codecs and Buffer
Byte manipulation is a core concern that applies to a lot of data pipeline configurations. It is extensively used by reactor-net to marshall and unmarshall bytes received or sent over IO.

The `reactor.io.buffer.Buffer` is a decorator for Java `ByteBuffer` handling, adding a series of operations. The goal is to minimize byte copy by playing with the ByteBuffer limits and reading or overwritting pre-allocated bytes. Tracking the ByteBuffer positions can quickly switch the developer brain into headache mode. At least it did that to us and we just decided to propose this simple tool to our users.

A simple Buffer manipulation as seen in one of our Groovy Spock test:

```
import reactor.io.buffer.Buffer

//...

given: "an empty Buffer and a full Buffer"
                def buff = new Buffer()
                def fullBuff = Buffer.wrap("Hello World!")

when: "a Buffer is appended"
                buff.append(fullBuff)

then: "the Buffer was added"
                buff.position() == 12
                buff.flip().asString() == "Hello World!"
```

A useful application for Buffer is Buffer.View, which is returned by multiple operations such as split(). It simply provides for a copy-free way to scan and introspect bytes from ByteBuffer. Buffer.View is also a kind of Buffer, so the same operations are exposed.

Reusing the same bytes for chunked read using a delimiter and Buffer.View:

```
byte delimiter = (byte) ';';
byte innerDelimiter = (byte) ',';

Buffer buffer = Buffer.wrap("a;b-1,b-2;c;d;");

List<Buffer.View> views = buffer.split(delimiter);

int viewCount = views.size();
Assert.isTrue(viewCount == 4);

for (Buffer.View view : views) {
    System.out.println(view.get().asString()); //prints "a" then "b-1,b-2", then "c" and finally "d"

    if(view.indexOf(innerDelimiter) != -1){
      for(Buffer.View innerView : view.get().split(innerDelimiter)){
        System.out.println(innerView.get().asString()); //prints "b-1" and "b-2"
      }
    }
}
```

Playing with Buffer can feel a bit low-level for the common marshalling/unmarshalling use cases and Reactor comes with a series of pre-defined converters called Codec. Some Codec will be requiring the appropriate extra dependency in the classpath to work, like Jackson for JSON manipulation.

Codec works in two ways, first it implements Function to encode anything directly and return the encoded data, usually under the form of Buffer. This is great but it does only work with stateless Codecs, the alternative is to use the returned encoding function from Codec.encoder().

**Codec.encoder() vs Codec.apply(Source)**

* Codec.encoder() returns a unique encoding function that should not be shared between different Threads.
* Codec.apply() directly encodes (and save an encoder allocation), but the Codec itself should be shared between Threads in that case

> Reactor Net handles that difference for you in fact by calling Codec.encoder for each new connection.

Codec can also decode data into from source type, usually Buffer for most of the Codec implementations. To decode a source data, we must retrieve a decoding function from Codec.decoder(). Unlike in the encoding side, there isnâ€™t any apply shortcut as the method is already overloaded for the encoding purpose. Like the encoding side, the decoding function should not be shared between Threads.

There are two forms of Codec.decoder() functions, one will simply return the decoded data where Codec.decoder(Consumer) will call the passed consumer on each decoding event.

**Codec.decoder() vs Codec.decoder(Consumer)**

* Codec.decoder() is a blocking decoding function, it will return directly the decoded data from the passed source.
* Codec.decoder(Consumer) can be used for non-blocking decoding, it will return nothing (null) and only invoke the passed Consumer once decoded. It can be combined with any asynchronous facility.

Using one of the predefined Codecs as verified in this Groovy Spock test:

```
import reactor.io.json.JsonCodec

//...

given: 'A JSON codec'
                def codec = new JsonCodec<Map<String, Object>, Object>(Map);
    def latch = new CountDownLatch(1)

when: 'The decoder is passed some JSON'
                Map<String, Object> decoded;
                def callbackDecoder = codec.decoder{
                  decoded = it
                  latch.countDown()
                }
                def blockingDecoder = codec.decoder()

                //yes this is real simple async strategy, but that's not the point here :)
                Thread.start{
                  callbackDecoder.apply(Buffer.wrap("{\"a\": \"alpha\"}"))
    }

    def decodedMap = blockingDecoder.apply(Buffer.wrap("{\"a\": \"beta\"}")

then: 'The decoded maps have the expected entries'
    latch.await()
                decoded.size() == 1
                decoded['a'] == 'alpha'
                decodedMap['a'] == 'beta'
```
